Each raster's flow vector slope was used to calculate the raster's LS-factor prior to determining its respective
 cell's average LS-factor.
Each raster along its respective cell's hydraulically most distant path used the raster's flow vector slope to
 calculate the cell's TC profile segment slope & lengths.
Each raster's terrain slope was used to calculate its respective cell's average land slope.
Orphan raster code:  F-means that no orphan channel raster(s) are involved for this cell ID;
Orphan raster code:  T-means that orphan channel raster(s) make up this cell.  The entire subarea for this new cell ID
                       is made up of reassigned channel raster(s) to a rightside cell whose subarea did not previously
                       have any rasters that were assigned to any related source, right-, or leftside cells.
